</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Have you ever wonder if it is possible to refresh the feeling of playing with LEGOs once you are near your forties? Indeed, it is possible but after ten years of engineering the idea was not only to play with them, but to create my own. This is the story of me creating my owns bricks while learning 3D printing and getting to know the MakerSpace56 at Vannes.</p>
<p><img alt="My own bricks" src="https://mesarpe.github.io/images/bricks.jpg"></p>
<p>Let us start by setting up my intent:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let us create programatically my own bricks in such a way that they are stackable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My programmatic bricks shall be composable, which is the same to say that I expect to create a 2x1 piece using a 1x1 piece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really love houses in the french Brittany, they are part of the cozy feeling of living in Bretagne. So, it would be nice to create a small set of parts capable of creating the smallest possible house.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is really important to choose the right profile for printing. Using default UltiMake Cura 5.6 Standard profile, the tiles are problematic to connect to the joists. I had to destroy the pieces and glue them together. For the rest of the pieces, I uses the dynamic profile (which has a better quality) and the results were better.</li>
<li>Some of the pieces were printed with a LONGER LK 1 and Creality Ender Pro 3 v3 SE.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software-Simulator</h3>
<h1>Improving the brick's design to cast them and improve the quality</h1>
<h2>Brick v2: enabling casting</h2>
<p>While building the first version of my brick, I was quite lucky. In the first shot, I managed to make some bricks that fit and are stackable, and in general, they worked pretty well.. However, when I moved to the casting part, the piece isn't perfect. The piece presents some defects, for example, that is really difficult to cast. Let us try to fix it.</p>
<p>The main issue with the version 1 of my brick was that it had an undercut. So basically this new design will expect not to have this under-cut and it simplifies the creation of the brick in two pieces mold.</p>
<p>Regarding the version number two, we printed two bricks. The bricks were very similar to the version one. The only difference is that we avoid having the undercut. We have done this by keeping the hollow cube. and adding a lid on top of it. that it's between the dents and the hollow cubes.. And in this way, it's simpler to make them mold. We had a few issues with the quality of printing (by printing the pieces with the dynamic profile, we are still having issues to interconnect the pieces.</p>
<p>[PHOTO]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had an issue with the printer, we had to recaliber everything. Is due to this issue that the bricks are not correctly interconnecting?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Brick v3: decoupled dents of bricks</h2>
<p>The idea of the version number 3 is a little bit different, we're going to try to decompose.  the brick into two pieces..  The main structure we see is composed of a plastic hollow cube and the interconnection.  of plastic..  The interconnection of plastic will do it by using wooden pins.</p>
<p>After printing the piece we have done a really small test. Basically we printed two hollow structures, the equivalent of two bricks, and we use a wooden pin to interconnect them. It is really solid and works really good.</p>
<p>[PHOTO]</p>
<h2>Brick v4: One piece casting and round dents</h2>
<p>This is a new test with round dents. It is very similar to LEGO. If I am not wrong, it could be possible to create a 3d mold to cast the LEGO pieces with one piece.</p>
<p>I would like to have a perfect fit for the bricks. Let us try to see the precision of the printer:</p>

<th>Comment</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>3.8</td>
<td>The bricks do not fit together. The dent pass through the hole, but they do not fit. They are loose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.9</td>
<td>The bricks fit together. The dent is slighly forced, but pieces still strongly together. Success</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.0</td>
<td>The bricks do not fit together easily, we have to force and still the fitting is not perfect.</td>
</tr>
