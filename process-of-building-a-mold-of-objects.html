<h2>Mold Casting: LEGO brick and LEGO plate</h2>
<h2>Mold Casting: esp32 case</h2>
<p>After creating my own esp32 case [INSERT LINK HERE], I was curious of the process of replicating my cases. Not only because I do not have a 3d printer but also for answering the question of how difficult could be to launch a small production for some object.</p>
<p>I learned a lot of things during this process. Some lessons about mold making and the other about casting the objects.</p>
<h3>Mold Casting</h3>

<ul>
<li>It is important to leave some space between the molds. I tried to minimize the silicone rubber used for the casting and this was an error. It is important to leave at least 1 cm of silicon between different molds. As we are removing the casted pieces from the mold, we squeeze the material. When the material is very thin, it ends up braking and letting place for anomalies in the pieces. We can see it in the dents of the cases. None of the replicated was perfect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cases Casting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Polyurethane casting: the polyurethane casting was successful. Initially it is transparent and once we pour it into the mold, it starts the process of cathalization (VERIFY?) and eventually it becomes white and rigid. I made two successful copies that we can see in the picture. I discovered that every part that must be thicker than 1 mm otherwise the piece is very fragile and may break while removing from the mold. The original lid was also 1 mm thick, but I put more polyurethane to make it thicker (by looking at the shape of the mold, we are sure that we can make it).</li>
<li>Epoxy casting: the epoxy casting was not very successful. Although I managed to make it very thin, it looks very fragile and some parts have been deformed. Nor the case, nor the lid are perfect and both have errors of casting. The only cool thing is that I can use the color I like.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: can we use the 3d printed cases with the replicated lids? Yes, it works pretty good.</p>
<p>Question: can we improve the quality of the replicas? Yes, we can sand them and it is very easy with any sand paper.</p>
