</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>My Garage is quite messy. I have already built a table to work, however I didn't manage to make it beautiful. The idea of this project is to beautify the table with a wall organizer. The wall organizer would be made with honeycombs and I expect to manage to hang some of my tools. As a golden point, I would like to </p>
<p>At least those that are useful most of the time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection Gloves, protection glasses, masks</li>
<li>hammer, spatules</li>
</ul>
<p>The wall looks as follows: </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">Wall</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Expected look</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="The Wall" src="wall.jpg"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Maradona" src="marado.png"> Maradona</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The wall is 1 meter (96cm) tall by around 1.5m (149cm). There are two electrical-wire tubes and two wood-supports. </p>
<p>I have been inspired by the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.printables.com/fr/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall/remixes</li>
<li>https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skadis-pegboard-combination-s89406365/</li>
<li>https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/snickra-8-piece-storage-board-set-gray-green-40518246/</li>
<li>https://www.multiboard.io</li>
<li>Threadboard</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential options for design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pegboard and hooks</li>
<li>Metal plates</li>
<li>Plastic plates</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to have images with a nice degree of details: at least 64 pixels (hexagons) tall; Diego requires a lot of hexagons to be visible. Basically, we have to estimate the size per hexagon and estimate the number of hexagons.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Let's do some numbers.</h2>
<p><strong>Grid size</strong>. The space available to create a grid is about 149 centimeters of width and 96 centimeter of height as previously said.</p>
<p><strong>Pin unit</strong> The idea is to create a big grid in which a lot of colored pins can be inserted, in order to create a pixelized image of a really large size. The unit for every one of the pins is 1.6cm per width and 1.6 cm of height. To have an idea a pin is the equivalent of a lego piece that we insert in a hole. As the pin size is 1.5cm x 1.5cm, we can allocate 84 x 60 dents.</p>
<p><strong>Pin Height</strong> I have made a few tests to measure the minimum size required for a dent: 3mm. In the test I compared 2mm, 5mm and 3mm. 2mm ended up being too small and slippery. 5mm is too big although it fits perfectly fine.</p>
<p><strong>Decomposing the grid</strong>. In OpenSCAD, we have created a few pin pieces that allow us to represent that subpart of this grid.  Every one of these pieces is composed of a 19.4 cm of width and height.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm</strong>. The structure of the grid chosen consists of a simple algorithm where every hole is numbered by its x and y coordinates (i.e. (x, y)). When both number of the pair of coordinates are even (i.e. x=2 and y=4 for example), we created a big hole (16mm) and for the rest of pixels, we use a hole of 10mm. The value of this number was chosen more of less randomly, but the 10mm holes can fit hooks available.</p>
<p>** Surface<strong>. As we said, the grid is composed of 16mm and 10mm holes. As the whole grid is a multiple of 16mm when we have a big hole, there is no surface to print. But when we have a 10mm hole, the surface for the hole is 16mm</strong>2 - 10mm**2:</p>
<p>Surface = (1.6^2 - 10^2) x 121 = 188.76 # 121 is the number of small holes</p>
<p>Volume = Surface * height = 188.75 * 0.5mm = 94.38 mm^2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was calculated that for a grid of 12x12, the number of big holes is given by $n^2 - (n-1)^2)$ and the rest are all small holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Clone of pieces with polyurethane.</h1>
<p>After successfully printing one piece of the big board, the idea was to multiply this piece by 34 times. The process of multiplication of pieces consists in the following..  We create a mod based on silicon and then we cast 34 pieces using polyurethane. The process of casting consists of mixing two parts of polyuretane and then mixing them for one minute and putting the liquid inside of the mold.</p>
<p>After waiting for three hours, the piece becomes ready: The liquid solidifies and the piece becomes one solid entity.</p>
<p>Then, the process of unmolding starts. It is very simple, we simply remove the pieces from the cast.</p>
<h1>Clearance after clone.</h1>
<p>After cloning the pieces, we have a small problem.</p>
<p>It looks like the clearance that was enough for the three printed pieces..  After cloning, the hole seems to be bigger, so the clearance needs to be reduced.</p>
<p>To fix the problem, basically we have to re-print the pieces, changing the clearance. The experiment consisted in changing the clearance to 0 and print 3 pieces.</p>

<p>the question is valid again: after cloning will it fit so good?</p>

<h2>Stack print</h2>
<p>There is something that I was willing to investigate since a long time: Stack Printing. Stack printing consist in printing multiple pieces one over the other one. By using this concept, we can multiply the number of pieces that we print in a batch. Of course, it does not mean that the printer will take less time. In general depending on the piece, we need to print a structure to hold it in place. This structure consumes filemanet and needs time to be built.</p>
<p>We are going to do a simple experiment: printing 4 dents, one on top of the other. Every dent will have the same coordinates x,y and will have a different z. The z for the first one will be 0. For the second one, z will be height of hte dent (7mm) plus layer height multiplied by two (in my case, 0.3 * 2). The third one respects the same principle so 15.2 and the forth one 22.8.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>very good. speed could be better</p>
<h2>Printed</h2>
<p>Big dents: 16.4 with 0.1 interspace (16.2) 32 (1h 30) : testing speed at 180mm/s</p>                </article>
